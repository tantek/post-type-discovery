        Post Type Discovery specifies an algorithm for determining the type of a post
        by what properties it has and potentially what value(s) they have, which helps 
        avoid the need for explicit post types that are being abandoned by modern post 
        creation UIs.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      Post type discovery is an explicit algorithm for inferring the type of a post from other properties of that post.
      </p>
      <p>
      Inferring the type of a post helps provide a bridge between systems without explicit post types 
      (e.g. [[Micropub]], jf2) to systems with explicit post types (e.g. [[ActivityPub]], [[AS2]]).
      </p>
      
      <section id='usecases' class='informative'>
        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
        <p>
        Both creation user interfaces, and post presentation designs are evolving to 
        directly use the presence or absence of specific properties (and their values) 
        directly, rather than depending on any kind of explicit "post type", thus why 
        bother discovering a post type in the first place? This section documents the 
        (few) use-case(s) that is/are known to date.

      <section id='synthesizing' class='informative'>
        <h3>Synthesizing explicit type formats</h3>
        <p>
          There are existing formats that require explicit post types 
          (e.g. ActivityStreams [[AS1]]), or are based on explicit post types,
          (e.g. ActivityStreams2 [[AS2]]), and code that consumes them expects explicit 
          post types. Post type discovery enabling automatic synthesizing of such 
          formats from posts that merely have a set of content related properties.

      <h2>Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        The Post Type Discovery algorithm ("the algorithm") discovers the type of a 
        post given a data structure representing a post with a flat set of properties 
        (e.g. Activity Streams (1.0 or 2.0) JSON, or JSON output from 
        [[microformats2-parsing]]), each with one or more values, by following these steps 
        until reaching the first "it is a(n) ... post" statement at which point the 
        "..." is the discovered post type.
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the post has an "rsvp" property with a valid value, 
            <br>Then it is an RSVP post.</li>
          <li>If the post has an "in-reply-to" property with a valid URL, 
            <br>Then it is a reply post.</li>
          <li>If the post has a "repost-of" property with a valid URL, 
            <br>Then it is a repost (AKA "share") post.</li>
          <li>If the post has a "like-of" property with a valid URL, 
            <br>Then it is a like (AKA "favorite") post.</li>
          <li>If the post has a "video" property with a valid URL, 
            <br>Then it is a video post. </li>
          <li>If the post has a "photo" property with a valid URL, 
            <br>Then it is a photo post. </li>
          <li>If the post has a "content" property with a non-empty value, 
            <br>Then use its first non-empty value as the content</li>
          <li>Else if the post has a "summary" property with a non-empty value, 
            <br>Then use its first non-empty value as the content</li>
          <li>Else it is a note post.</li>
          <li>If the post has no "name" property 
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or has a "name" property with an empty string value (or no value) 
            <br>Then it is a note post.</li>
          <li>Take the first non-empty value of the "name" property</li>
          <li>Trim all leading/trailing whitespace</li>
          <li>Collapse all sequences of internal whitespace to a single space (0x20) character each</li>
          <li>Do the same with the content</li>
          <li>If this processed "name" property value is NOT a prefix of the processed content, 
            <br>Then it is an article post.</li>
          <li>It is a note post.</li>

        </ul>

        Quoted property names in the algorithm are defined in [[!h-entry]].

    <section id='methodology' class='informative'>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        There are two important aspects to the methodology of the Post Type Discovery 
        algorithm: scope (why is something explicitly in the algorithm), and order 
        (why is something where it is in the algorithm).
      </p>

      <section id="scope">
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>
        The algorithm could attempt to cover innumerable potential hypothetical post 
        types, or take an evidence based approach, focusing on real world publishing 
        practices. This specification does the latter, specifically by placing a 
        minimum bar of documented real world publishing practices of different visually 
        apparent post types on the open web at recent (&lt; 1 year old) permalinks, each 
        with at least three independent implementations that have converged on what 
        properties (and potentially values thereof) they have to imply their visually 
        apparent post types. As a result of being evidence based, it is likely this 
        specification will expand over time as more apparent post types are published by 
        more convergent implementations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="order">
        <h3>Order</h3>
        <p>
          The algorithm must also specify an order (e.g. of precedence) that various 
          properties (and their values) imply various post types. The algorithm is 
          ordered by post types that are in general "richer" in terms of content as 
          well as show greater cognitive effort by the author.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id='othertypes' class='informative'>
      <h2>Other Types Under Consideration</h2>
      <p>
        Other types are being considered and will be included in the future iterations 
        of the algorithm based on convergence of publishing patterns and critical mass 
        of adoption thereof.

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <section id="ex-like">
        <h3>Like Post</h3>
        <p>
          Here is an example [[h-entry]] post from 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-like">Activity Streams 2.0 Vocabulary examples</a> [[AS2-vocab]]:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;div class="h-entry p-name"&gt;
  &lt;span class="p-author h-card"&gt;Sally&lt;/span&gt;
  liked
  &lt;a class="u-like-of"
    href="http://example.org/notes/1"&gt;
    http://example.org/notes/1
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

        <p>
          Following the algorithm, the step "If the post has a "like-of" property with 
          a valid URL" is satisfied and thus the algorithm returns that the post is a 
          "<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/like">like</a>" post.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given this semantic, an implementation can generate (or process as if generated 
          and consumed) the following AS2 JSON, in particular the <code>"@type": "Like"</code>
          in this output is what is determined by this algorithm:
        </p>
        <pre>{
  "@type": "Like",
  "actor": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "displayName": "Sally"
  },

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>What about a photo reply</h3>

      <p>
        Q: What about a reply that includes a photo?
      </p>

      <p>
        A: It's a reply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Q2: Should that show up as a "photo" post?
      </p>

      <p>
        A2: It should show up as a "reply" and not be in a user's published feed of their 
        photos. The user-centric design here is to treat replies separately, because in 
        practice, when users post replies to others' posts, and include a photo, the photos 
        typically assume the context of that other post, and would look odd outside of it 
        (e.g. in a generic "photos" feed). In addition, by not including reply photos in a 
        user's feed of their photos, it gives the user the freedom to reply to other posts 
        with whatever they wish, including photos, and not have those reply-specific photos 
        pollute their streams of "their stuff" that their followers subscribe to.
      </p>

      <p>
        A2a: From a presentation perspective, a reply should primarily be displayed as a 
        reply first, and then adapt accordingly to whatever other properties it may have.
      </p>
      <h3> Is a video tag sufficient </h3>
      <p>
        Q: Is a video tag sufficient to imply a video post?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No, video tags can be used for additional content e.g. inside an article. 
        Only relying on video tag markup would lead to false positives.
