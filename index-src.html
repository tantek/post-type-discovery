        Post Type Discovery specifies an algorithm for determining the type of a post
        (related issue: 
        <a href="https://github.com/tantek/post-type-discovery/issues/9">
          #9: Use AS2 specific language for post types</a>)
        by what properties it has and potentially what value(s) they have, which helps 
        avoid the need for explicit post types that are being abandoned by modern post 
        creation UIs. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>This specification was contributed to the W3C from the
         <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> community
        and is one of several related specifications being produced by the Social Web Working Group.
        More history and evolution of Post Type Discovery can be found on the
         <a href="https://indieweb.org/post-type-discovery">IndieWeb wiki</a>.

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      Post type discovery is an explicit algorithm for inferring the type of a post from other properties of that post.
      </p>
      <p>
      Inferring the type of a post helps provide a bridge between formats and protocols without explicit post types 
      (e.g. [[h-entry]], [[jf2]], [[micropub]], Atom ([[RFC4287]]), [[RSS-2.0]]) to those with explicit post types (e.g. [[ActivityPub]], [[AS2]]).
      For more details on those specifications see references, and for how they relate, see the overview document [[social-web-protocols]].
      Post type discovery can apply to any post data structure independent of serialization (e.g. HTML, JSON, etc.)
      </p>
    </section>
 
    <section id='usecases' class='informative'>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        Both creation user interfaces, and post presentation designs are evolving to 
        directly use the presence or absence of specific properties (and their values) 
        directly, rather than depending on any kind of explicit "post type", thus why 
        bother discovering a post type in the first place? This section documents the 
        (few) use-case(s) that is/are known to date.
      </p>
      <section id='synthesizing'>
      <h3>Synthesizing explicit type formats</h3>
      <p>
        There are existing formats that require explicit post types 
        (e.g. ActivityStreams [[AS1]]), or are based on explicit post types,
        (e.g. ActivityStreams2 [[AS2]]), and code that consumes them expects explicit 
        post types. Post type discovery enabling automatic synthesizing of such 
        formats from posts that merely have a set of content related properties.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id='aggregating-responses'>
      <h3>Aggregating responses by type</h3>
      <p>
        Modern social web posting systems implement multiple types of responses
        and provide user interfaces that show aggregate counts or collections of 
        those responses grouped by type, e.g. number of likes, reposts, replies.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id='notifications-wording'>
      <h3>Notifications wording and filtering</h3>
      <p>
        Many social web implementations provide notifications to a user 
        with response type specific wording, e.g. 
        "Alice commented on your photo", "7 people liked your video".
        Automatically generating both the specific wording of these notifications, 
        and deciding which to provide to the user, based on preferences and/or filtering, 
        requires determining the specific response type.

      <h2>Response Type Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        The Response Type Algorithm ("the response algorithm") is for specifically discovering the type of a response, 
        in particular as a result of receiving a [[!Webmention]], by analyzing the "source" from the Webmention, 
        called the "response" in the response algorithm.
        It is a proper subset of the general Post Type Algorithm (defined below).

          <li>If the response has an "rsvp" property with a valid value (one of "yes", "no", "maybe", "interested"), 
            <br>Then it is an RSVP.</li>
          <li>If the response has a "repost-of" property with a valid URL, 
            <br>Then it is a repost (AKA share).</li>
          <li>If the response has a "like-of" property with a valid URL, 
            <br>Then it is a like (AKA favorite).</li>

      <h2>Post Type Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        The Post Type Algorithm ("the algorithm") discovers the type of a 
        post given a data structure representing an item with a flat set of properties 
        (e.g. JSON output from [[microformats2-parsing]]), 
        each with one or more values, by following these steps 
        until reaching the first "it is a(n) ... post" statement at which point the 
        "..." is the discovered post type.
      </p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the post is an "event" item (may be a [[microformats2]] root class name of [[!h-event]]),
            <br>Then it is an event.</li>
          <li>If the post has an "rsvp" property with a valid value (one of "yes", "no", "maybe", "interested"), 
            <br>Then it is an RSVP post.</li>
          <li>If the post has a "repost-of" property with a valid URL, 
            <br>Then it is a repost (AKA "share") post.</li>

    <section id='methodology' class='informative'>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        There are two important aspects to the methodology of the Post Type Discovery 
        algorithm: scope (why is something explicitly in the algorithm), and order 
        (why is something where it is in the algorithm).
      </p>

      <section id="scope">
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>
        The algorithm could attempt to cover innumerable potential hypothetical post 
        types, or take an evidence based approach, focusing on real world publishing 
        practices. This specification does the latter, specifically by placing a 
        minimum bar of documented real world publishing practices of different visually 
        apparent post types on the open web at recent (&lt; 1 year old) permalinks, each 
        with at least three independent implementations that have converged on what 
        properties (and potentially values thereof) they have to imply their visually 
        apparent post types. As a result of being evidence based, it is likely this 
        specification will expand over time as more apparent post types are published by 
        more convergent implementations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="order">
        <h3>Order</h3>
        <p>
          The algorithm must also specify an order (e.g. of precedence) that various 
          properties (and their values) imply various post types. The algorithm is 
          ordered by post types that are in general "richer" in terms of content as 
          well as show greater cognitive effort by the author.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id='othertypes' class='informative'>
      <h2>Other Types To Consider</h2>
      <p>
        Other types may be included in future iterations 
        of the algorithms based on convergence of publishing patterns and critical mass 
        of adoption thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        See: <a href="https://indieweb.org/posts#Kinds_of_Posts">IndieWeb wiki: Kinds of Posts</a> 
        for a list of additional possible post types that have growing adoption.

    <section id='examples' class='informative'>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <section id="ex-like">
        <h3>Like Post</h3>
        <p>
          Here is an example [[h-entry]] post from 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-like">Activity Streams 2.0 Vocabulary examples</a> [[AS2-vocab]]:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;div class="h-entry p-name"&gt;
  &lt;span class="p-author h-card"&gt;Sally&lt;/span&gt;
  liked
  &lt;a class="u-like-of"
    href="http://example.org/notes/1"&gt;
    http://example.org/notes/1
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

        <p>
          Following the algorithm, the step "If the post has a "like-of" property with 
          a valid URL" is satisfied and thus the algorithm returns that the post is a 
          "<a href="https://indieweb.org/like">like</a>" post.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given this semantic, an implementation can generate (or process as if generated 
          and consumed) the following AS2 JSON, in particular the <code>"@type": "Like"</code>
          in this output is what is determined by this algorithm:

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>What about a photo reply</h3>

      <p>
        Q: What about a reply that includes a photo?
      </p>

      <p>
        A: It's a reply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Q2: Should that show up as a "photo" post?
      </p>

      <p>
        A2: It should show up as a "reply" and not be in a user's published feed of their 
        photos. The user-centric design here is to treat replies separately, because in 
        practice, when users post replies to others' posts, and include a photo, the photos 
        typically assume the context of that other post, and would look odd outside of it 
        (e.g. in a generic "photos" feed). In addition, by not including reply photos in a 
        user's feed of their photos, it gives the user the freedom to reply to other posts 
        with whatever they wish, including photos, and not have those reply-specific photos 
        pollute their streams of "their stuff" that their followers subscribe to.

      <p>
        A2a: From a presentation perspective, a reply should primarily be displayed as a 
        reply first, and then adapt accordingly to whatever other properties it may have.

      <h3> Is a video tag sufficient </h3>
      <p>
        Q: Is a video tag sufficient to imply a video post?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No, video tags can be used for additional content e.g. inside an article. 
        Only relying on video tag markup would lead to false positives.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/granary/">Granary</a> synthesizes ActivityStreams [[AS1]], 
          [[microformats2]], and Atom [[RFC4287]] from various input feeds and sources, and 
          as such has some code that can be considered in progress or even a partial 
          implementation of Post Type Discovery:

        <h3>p3k</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://indieweb.org/p3k">p3k</a> (a CMS) implements Post Type 
          Discovery internally within its [[micropub]] endpoint to automatically add 
          posts to various collections. E.g.: if this post is a reply, it goes in the 
          "replies" collection. if it's an RSVP, it goes in the "rsvps" and "replies" 
          collections.

        <h3>mf2util</h3>
        <p>
          mf2util exposes a function for post_type_discovery that takes an h-entry and 
          returns "like", "reply", "note", "article", etc.
